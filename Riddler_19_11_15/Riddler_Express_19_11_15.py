Inspired by Catriona Shearer (if you don’t know who she is, seriously, check out her puzzles), this week’s Riddler
Express is a geometric conundrum:

Upside-down semicircle inscribed inside a right side-up semicircle. The smaller semicircle is dark gray, while the
larger one is light gray.
The picture above shows two semicircles. The lighter region (inside the larger semicircle but outside the smaller one)
has an area of 7. What’s the area of the darker region?
"""

"""
Solution: One can verify that the radius of the smaller hemisphere is 1/sqrt(2) of the larger one since the tracing from
the center of the larger to the center of the smaller, then along to the point where both touch we form a 1-1-sqrt(2) 
right triangle. With this we know that the smaller hemisphere must have an area that is half the larger. The difference
in areas is therefore also the area of the smaller one.˚
