"""From Marcus Farbstein and Mark Baird, a logical mystery story, with your very freedom hanging in the balance:

You’re super rich, and you often joke with your cadre of intelligent friends and family about getting kidnapped. You all
agree that if you were ever kidnapped, the evildoers would knock you out so stealthily that you’d never feel the blow.
Then, one snowy night, you step out of a restaurant and, just as predicted, never feel the blow.

When you stir back into consciousness, it’s night, but it’s not snowy. You find yourself sitting on a beach. The sky is
clear, with no moon. In front of you stands a shadowy figure whose face you can’t make out. He throws a blocky
rectangular object at your feet. “That’s a satellite phone,” the figure growls. “It’s got one minute of battery left in
it. Use that to call your people to let ’em know you’re not dead — but not until daylight.” He tosses a paper bag next
to the sat phone. “That’s some sandwiches and water, enough for a few days. That’s salt,” he explains, waving toward the
surf. “If your people pay our ransom,” he continues, “We’ll come get you. Otherwise, there won’t be any more paper bags.
Remember, wait until daylight to make that call.”

He then turns and climbs into a dinghy in the light surf, starts its outboard motor and zooms away. All this time you’ve
been too groggy to do anything but listen. Now you watch as the dinghy disappears into the gloom, its wake a faint wash
of phosphorescence that quickly fades. Later, there’s a bare wink of lights at the horizon, presumably the mothership
getting underway and leaving.

Even though it’s a moonless night, there’s sufficient starlight to assess your surroundings. Your grogginess is gone and
you walk about. You’re on a tiny island, which you estimate is a bit more than a mile by half a mile. There are no
trees; it’s all flat sand. You taste the water rolled up by the surf, and it is indeed salt. The air is cool, but not
cold. Your wallet, expensive chronometer, keys, cell phone, jewelry and small change are all gone; all you have are the
clothes on your back — even your shoes and socks have been taken. The bag contains four sandwiches, all liverwurst with
peanut butter on cheap rye bread, and four one-pint bottles of water. No napkins. Your knowledge of astronomy is too
weak to try to estimate your location by the stars, but you’re not stupid. Before daybreak, you’ve worked out exactly
how you’ll use that minute of time on the satellite phone so that your people, who are also not stupid, will be able to
dispatch rescue.

What will you say?"""

"""It appears that this problem is not solved via a calculation per se. I imagine there will be many solutions around 
finding the longitude and latitude based on when dawn occurs and some other facts.
