At long last, Dakota Jones is close to finding the Lost Arc, a geometric antiquity buried deep in the sands of Egypt.
Along the way, she discovered what she described as a “highly symmetric crystal” that’s needed to precisely locate the
Arc. Dakota measured the crystal using her laser scanner and relayed the results to you. But nefarious agents have
gotten wind of her plans, and Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.

Locating the Arc is now up to you. To do that, you must recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota’s laser scanner.
The scanner takes a 3D object, and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension. Here’s the looping
animation file the scanner produced for the crystal:

What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal? No pressure — Dakota Jones, nay, the entire world, is counting on
you to locate the Lost Arc and ensure its place in a museum!

Answer: It's likely a cube with the cross-section starting at one of the corners.
