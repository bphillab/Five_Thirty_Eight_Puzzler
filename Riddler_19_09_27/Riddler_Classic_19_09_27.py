'''
Riddler League Baseball, also known as the RLB, consists of three teams: the Mississippi Moonwalkers, the Delaware
Doubloons and the Tennessee Taters.

Each time a batter for the Moonwalkers comes to the plate, they have a 40 percent chance of getting a walk and a 60
percent chance of striking out. Each batter for the Doubloons, meanwhile, hits a double 20 percent percent of the time,
driving in any teammates who are on base, and strikes out the remaining 80 percent of the time. Finally, each batter for
the Taters has a 10 percent chance of hitting a home run and a 90 percent chance of striking out.

During the RLB season, each team plays an equal number of games against each opponent. Games are nine innings long and
can go into extra innings just like in other baseball leagues. Which of the three teams is most likely to have the best
record at the end of the season?
