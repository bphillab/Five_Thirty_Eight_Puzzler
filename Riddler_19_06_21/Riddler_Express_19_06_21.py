Problem:
Paul Schafer, a very long walk:

You find yourself on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe and you start a long journey on foot by walking southeast. After
you cross the border into Utah, you keep walking. When you reach the Four Corners Monument, you step diagonally across
it into New Mexico. There, you replenish your water supply and walk east for many miles until you cross into Oklahoma.
You keep walking east until you reach Tulsa. You rest up for a few days and then head east to Fayetteville, Arkansas.
Here, you turn southward and hike the 300 miles to Shreveport, Louisiana. You enjoy a po’boy sandwich and turn back
toward the north. You cross back into Arkansas, step into Missouri close to Branson, and then, in Iowa, you pass just a
few miles east of Des Moines as you head north. Finally, you decide you’re too tired to go on, so you end your trek at
the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota.

You’ve just walked through parts of nine states. What do these nine contiguous states have in common that none of the
other 41 states share?
