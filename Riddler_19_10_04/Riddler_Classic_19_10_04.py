From Joel Lewis, this week’s Riddler Classic is a birthday puzzle for the ages:

The classic birthday problem asks about how many people need to be in a room together before you have better-than-even
odds that at least two of them have the same birthday. Ignoring leap years, the answer is, paradoxically, only 23 people
— fewer than you might intuitively think.

But Joel noticed something interesting about a well-known group of 100 people: In the U.S. Senate, three senators happen
to share the same birthday of October 20: Kamala Harris, Brian Schatz and Sheldon Whitehouse.

And so Joel has thrown a new wrinkle into the classic birthday problem. How many people do you need to have
better-than-even odds that at least three of them have the same birthday? (Again, ignore leap years.)
