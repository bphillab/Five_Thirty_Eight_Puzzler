Riddler Express
Riddler City is a large circular metropolis, with countless square city blocks that each have a side length of 1 km.
A small section of the city, composed of 36 blocks, is shown in the diagram below:

Riddler city blocks
At the very center of the city lies Riddler City Hall. Its many employees all walk to and from work, and their homes
are evenly scattered across the city. The sidewalks they walk along have always been adjacent to the streets â€” but
that may be changing.

Recently, several city hall employees submitted a petition, requesting that the sidewalks should no longer lie
alongside the streets. Instead, they want the sidewalks to cut diagonally across the city, connecting nearby street
intersections. These proposed sidewalks are represented by the thicker blue lines in the diagram below:

Riddler City diagonal sidewalks
The mayor of Riddler City has tasked you with resolving this dispute in a mathematical manner. She would like you to
answer the following question: What fraction of the city hall employees would have a shorter walk home (that is,
to the street intersection nearest to their home) if the city replaced its traditional sidewalks with these diagonal
sidewalks?
