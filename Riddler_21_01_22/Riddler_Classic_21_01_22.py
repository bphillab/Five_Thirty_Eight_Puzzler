Riddler Classic
Congratulations, you’ve made it to the finals of the Riddler Ski Federation’s winter championship! There’s just one
opponent left to beat, and then the gold medal will be yours.

Each of you will complete two runs down the mountain, and the times of your runs will be added together. Whoever skis
in the least overall time is the winner. Also, this being the Riddler Ski Federation, you have been presented
detailed data on both you and your opponent. You are evenly matched, and both have the same normal probability
distribution of finishing times for each run. And for both of you, your time on the first run is completely
independent of your time on the second run.

For the first runs, your opponent goes first. Then, it’s your turn. As you cross the finish line, your coach
excitedly signals to you that you were faster than your opponent. Without knowing either exact time, what’s the
probability that you will still be ahead after the second run and earn your gold medal?

Extra credit: Over in the snowboarding championship, there are 30 finalists, including you (apparently,
you’re a dual-sport threat!). Again, you are the last one to complete the first run, and your coach signals that you
are in the lead. What is the probability that you’ll win gold in snowboarding?

For this problem the distribution isn't necessary, but the EC does require some work.
